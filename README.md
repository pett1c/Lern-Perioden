# ãƒ» What is this repository about?

This repository contains all the projects I've ever created in the form of ***learning periods (Lern-periode)***, which are carried out in the ***learning atelier (Lern-Atelier)*** of the ***Berufsfachschule Baden (BBB)***, which is part of the ***Informatikmittelschule (IMS)***.

***Note:*** Some of the folders only contain a `readme.md` document with a direct link to the repository created on the basis of this learning period. The `readme.md` document itself describes the documentation in a format corresponding to the learning period system.
